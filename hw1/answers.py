**Your answer: 1. False  2. False  3. True**

**explanation**
1.The in-sa0mple error a determnistic value calculated on the training dataset (only), 
  independed of the test dataset. 
  the test dataset helps us to estimate the out-of-sample error. 

2. we can split out dataset into a zero size training dataset, and full size test dataset.
   such split would make any model equally good. and so training would not change our initial guess.
   and no learning would be done at all.
   
3. in cross validation we change and train our training a and validation split to get a better optimization for our hyperparameters
   using the test set in our cross validation would contaminate our out-of-sample estimation. so we should not use it.

```python
# A code block
a = 2
```
An equation: $e^{i\pi} -1 = 0$

part1_q2 = r"""
**Your answer: Not justified**

by using the test set to determine the $\lambda$ we damage the ability to estimate our model's out-of-sample error.
because we choose the $\lambda$ that will produce better results specificly on the test set and therefoe the test seete will no longer
new unseen data from the theoretical distribution.
